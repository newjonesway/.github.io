    	<p>Phillip and Hannah are Superhosts on Airbnb and highly rated on HomeAway. We have a total of three properties that you can find on either site.  We mostly only rent for longer time periods ~1 month. We accept well trained pets at all properties as long as you clean up after them! None of our properties smell like pets and we'd like to keep it that way! If you are new to AirBnB or HomeAway, use the referal links below to get refferal rewards. Feel free to check out our profile and/or properties below. We are excited to share our properties with you!</p>

    					<p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16606552">I loved the welcoming environment in a nice quiet neighborhood, still very close to shopping/dinning and freeway entrances. Easy access to a ton of Wasatch canyons! Phillip & Hanna had an authentic sense of hospitality. get there at the right time of year and get fresh picked peaches from the beautiful large backyard!</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/135324"> This is a great place. Super convenient to get anywhere in the valley. Walking distance to an amazing pizza place, dog park and Parleys trail. Phillip was very thoughtful and made sure we had everything we needed.</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6831030">This is a cute little place in the middle of Sugar House. Safe, quiet, easy on/off the 80. Close to lots and lots of great food. The house is perfect size for a small family. Two nice bedrooms and a cozy living area. The kitchen is great for simple needs and a little eating area perfect for three. Philip is a lovely host and he and Hannah will direct you to whatever you could need in the area.</a></p>

   <blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/135324">Phillip and Hannah provided a great place to stay while I was looking for a more permanent place in Salt Lake City. Communication was great, and the neighbourhood is very quiet and friendly. Being right behind Blue Star Cafe was an especial plus!</a></p>
